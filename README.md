# 🎵 BeatStore

**BeatStore** is a modern Java-based REST API designed to manage and distribute music beats. It is built with **Spring Boot**, integrates secure password handling, validations, and includes CI/CD workflows. This project is part of my portfolio to showcase clean architecture, test-driven development, and scalable backend solutions.
